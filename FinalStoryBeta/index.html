            <p>Late into a College Park City Council meeting on Sept. 9, Kenny Young, the city manager, put on a large Napoleon-style hat. Taped to the front of it was an index card with two words written on it: annexation proclamation.</p>
            <p>For the next hour, Young explained the city’s proposal to expand its borders and what that process would take. Some residents think annexation, like Napoleon’s conquests, is an overreach, while some city officials see it differently.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.collegeparkmd.gov/directory.aspx?EID=71" target="_blank">Denise Mitchell</a>, a College Park councilmember, said she wants to annex so city services can go to nearby areas that are not being serviced by the county. Mitchell was the one who asked for the proposal, though she said it’s been talked about for a while.</p>
            <p>According to the <a href="https://www.mdmunicipal.org/" target="_blank">Maryland Municipal League</a>, a nonprofit union of towns and cities, annexation is the process of legally including an unincorporated area within the limits of a city.</p>
            <p>In his presentation, the city manager explained the different areas the city is thinking about annexing. They are scattered around the city’s border. Some of the property contains homes and apartment complexes, while others contain churches. Part of the land is privately owned, while some of it is owned by the Prince George’s County government and the federal government.</p>

        <div class="large-12 medium-12 small-12 cell">
            <p>For an annexation to be valid, the new city border has to be contiguous, or connected the entire way around, said <a href="https://shpa.com/team/robert-j-antonetti-jr/" target="_blank">Robert J. Antonetti Jr.</a>, a lawyer familiar with annexations. There also can’t be any nonannexed properties surrounded by annexed ones, he said.</p>
            <p>David Dorsch, who has lived in College Park for nearly 50 years, said the city shouldn’t annex the land unless it has a need for it.</p>
            <p>“That's my tax money you're using to do that with. And if you've got too much tax money that you can afford to do all these things, then you need to lower my tax rates,” he said.</p>
            <p>Mitchell said she doesn’t know if expanding city services would raise taxes for city residents.</p>
            <p>“That's something we would need to work with our department public services as well as our public works director to see if at all what we need to hire and more employees to expand on the services that will be rendered,” she said.</p>
            <p>However, as a part of being incorporated into the city, residents in the annexed areas would have to start paying city taxes, she said. She also emphasized that the city is only at the beginning stages of the process.</p>

        <div class="large-12 medium-12 small-12 cell">
           <h3>The Beltsville Agricultural Research Center</h3>
            <p>The largest swath of land in the city’s proposal is the <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-barc/beltsville-agricultural-research-center/" target="_blank">Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center</a>, or BARC. Since the early 1900s, the 6,500 acre property has been a hub of agricultural research in the United States.</p>
            <p>It’s owned by the federal government and, earlier this year, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/sm-1078-015.pdf" target="_blank">announced</a> it’s planning to close the facility as a part of efforts to consolidate the Department of Agriculture.</p>
            <p>Oscar Gregory grew up in Beltsville, which is an unincorporated area just north of College Park, and his father was a researcher at BARC. If it’s annexed, he worries the land could be developed, he said.</p>
            <p>“I think that it should be preserved as a natural area and not developed at all,” he said.</p>
            <p>Mitchell agrees with him. In fact, the potential closure of BARC is part of the reason she wanted to start the annexation process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="large-7 medium-7 small-12 cell">
           
            <p>“For me, personally, I'm not looking to develop on the land. I'm looking to protect it environmentally,” Mitchell said.</p>
            <p>Legally, it would be very difficult for someone to develop BARC. That’s because, if any part of it is sold, <a href="https://govt.westlaw.com/mdc/Document/NC3601E90D21811E18503F3841F89E59E?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=DocumentItem&contextData=%28sc.Default%29" target="_blank">Maryland law</a> requires it to be used as “agricultural open space.”</p>
           <p>This is not the first time College Park has considered annexing BARC, or annexation in general. According to Geographer D.W. Rowlands, the city tried to annex part of BARC in the 1960s. That proposal failed because multiple stakeholders, including residents of Beltsville, were opposed to it, she said.</p>
            <p>College Park first annexed land in 1953, eight years after the city was established. Since then, it has annexed land seven times. Part of the rise in annexation was due to a change in state law, which gave cities and towns the ability to annex land on their own, without having to go through the General Assembly, she said.</p>
            <p>One thing we can learn from past annexations, she said, is to think ahead: “If you're going to annex something, annex a neighborhood. Don't annex three random properties.”</p>

            <h3>How does annexation work?</h3>
            <p>The first step is for the city to finalize its plan, Mitchell said. To do that, it would need to decide on what land it wants to annex, engage with residents and county officials and figure out what the legal process would be.</p>
            <p>Antonetti said the first step in the process is for the city to get permission from both the annexed areas’ residents and its property owners by having them sign a petition.</p>
            <p>Next, he said the city needs to approve a plan that includes the exact land it wants to annex, how city services will extend to this land and how the annexation will be paid for.</p>
            <p>Then, a public hearing is held, after which the city will vote to approve the annexation. After that, there is a short window where multiple stakeholders including city residents, residents in the annexed area and the county council can ask for a referendum to be held.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 cell">
            <p>He also said that annexing federal property, like BARC, would require the federal government to classify it as surplus.</p>
            <p>Mitchell hopes the annexation will be finished by the end of 2027. She thinks that starting this process is an opportunity to have a robust discussion about the future of the city.</p>
            <p>“I know some people are reluctant or hesitant, but I think within goodwill that we are going to be good partners and we are just willing to be open and transparent and honest with our intentions,” she said.</p>
